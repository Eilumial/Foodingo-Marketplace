# Foodingo-Marketplace
(Group project) FYP for SMU, client is the now-defunct Foodingo app/company. Vendor-Supplier Management System.

Basically a marketplace for vendors (restaurant owners) to discover suppliers via catalogue searches, manage their dishes by forming recipes with ingredients required per dish and place orders for ingredients with suppliers. For suppliers, they are able to manage their catalogues and manage orders from vendors. Was created after on-the-ground business research for the client.
